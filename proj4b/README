lab4b.c: Source file for our program. It reads temperature from the sensors and outputs the temperature along with the time of reading. log option allows appending output to a file and period controls the periodicity of the output. Scale option determines whether temperature is calculated in Fahrenheit or Celsius. Program also allows executing certain commands typed by the user.

Makefile: 
	lab4b: builds the program, used for default
	check: basic tests for application
	clean: delete programs and output generated by the Makefile
	list: creates the tarball
README: contains descriptions and resources used to build out the program
